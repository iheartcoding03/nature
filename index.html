Summed up, this one little word coined in 1985, is a combination of biological and diversity, representing the fantastic complexity of life on Earth. Biodiversity is also greatly under threat. Despite what seemed like a hiatus for the natural world from the slowdown of the last two years, nature needs our care and attention more than ever. Much conservation work was put at risk or on hold due to a loss of charitable support. And without tourism revenue funding the protection of ecosystems and wildlife, thousands of acres and species are vulnerable to exploitation.</p></td>

                <p><small>Since the natural world needs all of its interconnected ecosystems to be balanced for biology and geography to work in harmony together, for the benefit of humanity today and tomorrow, we need to nourish nature’s way of being to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases hitting our atmosphere. Time is running out to tackle the much-needed reduction in carbon emissions is the overriding message from scientists. One of the best ways to be part of the solution when travelling? Book nature-positive holidays that support conservation and stop our planet’s systems from short-circuiting.</small></p>
